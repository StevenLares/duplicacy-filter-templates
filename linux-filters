# This Duplicacy filter template is designed for the home directory of a Linux machine.
# It may be used for both servers and desktops.

# As a general rule, do not back up any cache data reachable from your home directory.
# Placed at the top, since Duplicacy applies its filters from top to bottom.
# You may add more cache directories if your system has additional cache folders with different names
-*/cache/


# Add lines for programs that use .config as a place to store their cache files.
# In this example, these programs do not respect their own cache naming conventions
# and sometimes place them top level.
# A few examples have been included: you may adjust, add or remove as you wish
-.config/JetBrains/
-.config/BraveSoftware/
-.config/google-chrome/
-.config/spotify/
-.config/Slack/


# After all cache has been excluded, the remaining contents in the config folder are included
+.config/*


# Now we move on to hidden files and folders that you may wish to include in the backup
# Note that in a later step, any hidden file or folder not explicitly included for backups
# will be filtered out.


# hidden folders:
+.preferences/*
+.var/*

# hidden files:
+.bash_aliases
+.bash_history
+.bash_logout
+.bashrc
+.gitconfig
+.latexmkrc
+.profile
+.profile.bak
+.qwe.data
+.viminfo
+.vimrc


# In this code block example, the plasma-vault folder in .local/share is included
# but the rest of local/share/ is excluded.
# You can use a similar set of patterns (in the same order) to achieve a similar outcome
# If you do not have a need for this usecase, you can comment these out

# As mentioned before, any hidden file or folder not included above
# will be filtered out by this rule
-.*


# At this point, hidden files have been excluded / included from the backups
# The backup patterns will now move on to excluding non-hidden folders and files
# In a later step, any non-hidden file or folder not explicitly excluded
# will be filtered out.


# Non-hidden exclusions:
-Backups/*
-bin/*
-Bundled Programs/*
-Vaults/*
-Downloads/*
-Calibre Library/*

# Specialized exclusions here
# Delete these if they don't fit your use case, or add your own
# This exclusion removes the versioning left behind by Syncthing,
# since Duplicacy already does versioning
-Subscribed/*/.stversions/*


# Remaining non-hidden files/folders (not excluded above)
# will be included
